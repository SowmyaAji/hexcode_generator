Weâ€™d like you to write us a program that:
Generates 8-digit hexadecimal codes to be used for 2FA.


The rules are as follows:
Every time you run the program, it should emit one 8-digit hexadecimal code;
It should emit every possible code before repeating;
It should not print "odd-looking" codes such as 0xAAAAAAAA or 0x01234567 or any commonly used words, phrases, or hexspeak such as 0xDEADBEEF;
Codes should be emitted in apparently random order.
